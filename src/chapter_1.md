Explain the cargo workspace, how crates are splitted and etc...

```
yeah, thats normal
its because that repository is a cargo workspace
you will see within it there is a directory called cv
that is where the actual cv crate is
its a part of the workspace
the whole project is split into tiny crates so people dont have to pull them all in through cv
but for a beginner or someone that just wants everything, using cv is recommended
the mono repo contains all these sub crates in this cargo workspace
you will want to add your examples there as well, but you can keep them separate for now as you work it out
